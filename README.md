# Automatic Solar Panel Cleaning System
Welcome to the repository for our Automatic Solar Panel Cleaning System project. In this endeavor, we have harnessed the power of Arduino, motors, and various other electrical components to create a comprehensive system capable of autonomously cleaning solar panels.

Originally, our vision encompassed the integration of a machine learning model designed to discern the optimal moments for the system to initiate solar panel cleaning. However, we had to determine whether reduced efficiency stemmed from dust accumulation or inclement weather conditions, necessitating sensors such as temperature, wind, and light sensors. Yet, upon careful consideration, we acknowledged that implementing this array of sensors would significantly escalate the overall expenses associated with the system. Consequently, we made the strategic decision to forego this approach.

In this repository, you will find our project's source code, schematics, documentation, and other resources. Feel free to explore, contribute, and adapt our work for your own projects. Your feedback and involvement are greatly appreciated as we continue to refine and enhance this automatic solar panel cleaning system.

Thank you for taking an interest in our project!
